# San Diego Budget Data

San Diego has a nice data portal where you can get lots of information about the city: https://data.sandiego.gov/  

I like it for data science examples because it is less studied than some of the really common datasets.

Today we will be exploring the operating budget for the city, which you can learn more about and download here: https://data.sandiego.gov/datasets/operating-budget/

Their website has been really slow lately, so I made a copy in this folder too.

## From questions to metrics

Today I want you to come up with a question you might have about the city budget, and then try to figure out how to answer it with data.  This is a common data science activity - in fact, I think that translating from plain-language questions to math and code is the most important part of the job!

Let's look at one example question:

- "How has the budget changed over the last 10 years?  What categories have increased or decreased the most?"

This seems like a straightforward question, but there are lots of things to consider!  First, there is an operating budget and a capital budget. Is this asking about one or both? There is also proposed, adopted, and actual expenses, which are all slightly different. Finally, the question about "increased or decreased" might mean total dollars or percentages.

In short, when you are answering these questions you have to make a lot of choices - the translation from plain-language to math isn't straightforward!  Your job is to understand the impacts of the choices you are making, and what is really being asked in the question, in order to be able to do a clear analysis.

## Assignment

1. Think about how you might be able to process the data to answer the question above.
2. Load the data into Tableau and see if you can get there!
